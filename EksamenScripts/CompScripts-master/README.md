# Compsys scritps

## Useage

Found in the final folder there is a exam ready setup to take with you to the compsys exam.

If you know vue or js, you can edit the code as you please with the build setup described below.
NOTICE: if you run the build, remember to update the script and style paths in dist/index.html before moving them into final, or else the file won't import the js and css files.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
